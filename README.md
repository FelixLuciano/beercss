## Applying "the beer way" in css?

This project was guided by the **"Germany Beer Purity Law"** or **"Reinheitsgebot"** created in 1516. This law states that beer should only be brewed with the following ingredients: **water**, **barley malt** and **hops**. Only 3 ingredients. Exciting, right? So we thinking about It and our 3 ingredients are: **settings**, **elements** and **helpers**. This sounds weird at first time, because It's not BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS, ITCSS, "Utility first" or any other approach. Our approach doesn't avoid some bad practices, but is lightweight, tasty and pure like a beer. Just try it and feel it! üòÅ

```
|  SETTINGS     |       // The settings affects all document
|---------------|----|
|               |    |
|  ELEMENTS     |    |  // The elements are the components, widgets or tags
|               |    |
|---------------|    |
|               |    |
|               |    |
|  HELPERS      |----|  // The common helpers makes the elements more scalable and customizable
|               |
|               |
|---------------|
```

### DO:

```
// 1 setting to 1 document
<html class="settings">...</html>

// 1 element to N helpers
<element class="helper helper">...</element>
<div class="element helper helper">...</div>

// apply css rules like this
.element.helper {...}
.element > .element {...}
.element > .helper {...}
```

### DON'T:

```
// N elements to 1 tag
<div class="element element helper">...</div>

// avoid dependencies
<div class="element">
  <div class="element-header">...</div>
  <div class="element-content">...</div>
  <div class="element-footer">...</div>
</div>

// apply css rules like this
.element.element {...}
.element .element {...}
.element .helper {...}
```
