- It does a lot of combinations.
- It's easy to work with Vue, React, Angular, Svelte and others.
- **It has about 10kb.**
- **It has the most simple html output around.**
- It does not need tons of documentation to explain it.
- It's fast to learn, read and write code.
- **It's like pure malt beer, only native and standard code.**
- No tricks, no build steps and no abstraction layers to try reduce your final code.
